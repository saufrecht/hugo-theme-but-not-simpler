# hugo-theme-but-not-simpler
Hugo Theme with Solarized theme, automatic dark support. HTML, CSS, and Go onlyâ€”no Javascript, SCSS, no social.

Version negative 1: code dump after transfer from local layout to theme layout.  Presumably not working since adjustments to have it work as a theme haven't been made.  Also, no example site or other necessities for sharing theme.
