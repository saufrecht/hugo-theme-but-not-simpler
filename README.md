# hugo-theme-but-not-simpler
Hugo Theme with Solarized theme, automatic dark support. HTML, CSS, and Go onlyâ€”no Javascript, SCSS, no social.

Version negative 1: code dump after transfer from local layout to theme layout.  Presumably not working since adjustments to have it work as a theme haven't been made.  Also, no example site or other necessities for sharing theme.

TODO:
- Get it to work as a theme, following standard hugo theme rules
  - with example site
  - with custom code and data
  - screenshots
  - setup and customization instructions in README
- remove tech debt
  - clean up and simplify the css
    - find and remove unused
    - find and remove duplicate
    - fine-tune the fonts and spacing
      - move all block spacing to margin-bottom where possible, eliminating margin-top
    - find a free font to use as default, rather than Quadraat
  - fix any TODOs in the code
  - make the navigation (forward and backward links) not ugly
  - get a cleaner way to split markdown-generated footnote material to its separate CSS grid area.
- new features
  - icon images for categories
  - integrate Docbook-generated chapters
